# Plant Disease Identification with TensorFlow

This project is inteded to explore the identification of agriculturally significant diseases using image classification algorithms in the TensorFlow environment. Ideally the final product will be wrapped in TFLite and deployable in a mobile format. Whether deployed via IoT sensors or a hand-held device in the field, the real value of systems like these would be ease of use in the field.
